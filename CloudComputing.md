# **Cloud Computing**
## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. It is the on-demand availability of data storage resources(cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.

For it to be considered "cloud computing," you need to access your data or your programs over the Internet, or at the very least, have that data synced with other information over the Web. In a big business, you may know all there is to know about what's on the other side of the connection; as an individual user, you may never have any idea what kind of massive data processing is happening on the other end. The end result is the same: with an online connection, cloud computing can be done anywhere, anytime.
