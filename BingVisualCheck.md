### Discover intelligent context identification
Use smart identification of image content to recognize celebrities, find products, or search for related content. Bing Visual Search automatically identifies the type of picture, recognizing image context whether it is a barcode, a business card, or a product.

### Enhance product recommendations for your business
Create compelling product recommendations for your domain through visually similar images and products. For example, build a crop-free product selection experience for your users to detect and delineate fashion products automatically.

### Make your applications and devices intelligent
Add search intelligence to your apps and devices. Integrate with any image source to get annotations and information, whether using a bot, mobile device, or output from another Cognitive Service.

### Augment image understanding through OCR
Extract structured textual information to build better search results by reading the text in images using optical character recognition (OCR).
