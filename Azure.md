# Microsoft Azure

## What is Azure?
At its core, Azure is a public cloud computing platform—with solutions including <b>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</b>, <b>Platform as a Service (PaaS</b>), and <b>Software as a Service (SaaS)</b> that can be used for services such as analytics, virtual computing, storage, networking, and much more. It can be used to replace or supplement your on-premise servers.

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS quickly scales up and down with demand, letting you pay only for what you use. It helps you avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructure. Each resource is offered as a separate service component, and you only need to rent a particular one for as long as you need it. A cloud computing service provider, such as Azure, manages the infrastructure, while you purchase, install, configure, and manage your own software—operating systems, middleware, and applications.
