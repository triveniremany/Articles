## What is Azure?
At its core, Azure is a public cloud computing platformâ€”with solutions including <b>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</b>, <b>Platform as a Service (PaaS</b>), and <b>Software as a Service (SaaS)</b> that can be used for services such as analytics, virtual computing, storage, networking, and much more. It can be used to replace or supplement your on-premise servers.

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user.
